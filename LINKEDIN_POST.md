## Main Post

🚀 Excited to share my latest project: **RapidReader** – a speed reading tool that helps you consume text faster and with less eye strain!

📖 **What is RapidReader?**
RapidReader uses the RSVP (Rapid Serial Visual Presentation) technique to display one word at a time in a fixed position. This eliminates the need for eye movements across lines, allowing you to read at higher speeds without the usual fatigue.

✨ **Key Features:**
• **Optimal Recognition Point (ORP)** – Highlights the pivot letter in each word so your eyes know exactly where to focus
• **Context Preview** – Shows surrounding words to maintain comprehension while reading at speed
• **Customizable Themes** – Light, dark, and sepia modes for comfortable long reading sessions
• **PDF Support** – Upload PDFs and the app extracts text automatically
• **Progress Tracking** – Resume exactly where you left off
• **Privacy First** – All data stored locally in your browser, nothing leaves your device

🎯 **The Science Behind It:**
By presenting words in a single fixed location, RSVP reduces saccadic eye movements and re-fixations. Combined with adjustable WPM (words per minute) control, you can gradually increase reading speed while maintaining comprehension.

🔧 **Built with:**
React, TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS, and deployed on GitHub Pages.

Whether you're reading research papers, articles, or books, RapidReader helps you accelerate your knowledge intake without sacrificing comprehension.

**RapidReader: Accelerating Knowledge Intake Through RSVP Technology**

In our information-dense world, the ability to read quickly while maintaining comprehension is increasingly valuable. That's why I built RapidReader – a web application that leverages the RSVP (Rapid Serial Visual Presentation) technique to help users read faster and more efficiently.

**The Problem with Traditional Reading**

When we read traditionally, our eyes make constant movements (saccades) across lines of text and frequently re-fixate on words. These movements consume time and mental energy, limiting our reading speed and contributing to eye fatigue.

**The RSVP Solution**

RSVP eliminates these inefficiencies by presenting one word at a time in a fixed location. RapidReader enhances this with:

1. **Optimal Recognition Point (ORP)**: Each word has a "pivot letter" that's most efficient for recognition. RapidReader centers and emphasizes this point, helping your eyes lock onto the most important part of each word.

2. **Context Awareness**: Pure RSVP can feel disorienting. RapidReader displays a dimmed preview of surrounding words, maintaining sentence context and improving comprehension.

3. **Customizable Speed**: Adjustable WPM settings let you find your natural pace and gradually increase speed over time.

4. **Privacy-First Design**: All content and progress data stay in your browser – nothing is sent to external servers.

**Technical Implementation**

Built with React, TypeScript, and Vite, RapidReader features:
- PDF text extraction for seamless document reading
- Three theme options (light, dark, sepia) for comfortable extended sessions
- LocalStorage-based persistence for progress tracking
- Clean, distraction-free interface focused on the reading experience

**Results**

Users can typically increase their reading speed significantly while maintaining or even improving comprehension, thanks to the reduced cognitive load from eliminated eye movements.

**Try It Yourself**

RapidReader is open source and freely available:
- Live app: https://bryan-cee.github.io/rapid-reader/
- GitHub repo: https://github.com/Bryan-Cee/rapid-reader

Whether you're reading research papers, technical documentation, or leisure content, RapidReader can help you accelerate your knowledge intake.

What's your experience with speed reading? Have you tried RSVP-based tools before? I'd love to hear your thoughts!
